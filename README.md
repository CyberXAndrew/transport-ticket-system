### Description

Transport ticket system project is a Java-based Spring Boot microservice providing a REST API for managing
transportation ticket purchases.It includes user registration, ticket browsing, and purchase functionality.
Key features include filtering and pagination, input validation, and Swagger API documentation. Additional features
implemented include authentication by JWT access & refresh tokens,role-based authorization, Redis caching, and Kafka
integration.

### Key Features

* **User Registration:** Allows users to register with a unique login, password, and full name.
* **Ticket Browsing:** Provides a REST endpoint to retrieve a paginated and filtered list of available tickets. 
Filters include date/time, origin/destination (substring matching), and carrier name (substring matching).
* **Ticket Purchase:** Enables users to purchase available tickets. Purchased tickets are no longer available for
purchase.
* **Purchase History:** Allows users to view a list of their purchased tickets.
* **Input Validation:** Validates all REST method input data, returning HTTP 40Ñ… errors with descriptive messages 
for invalid input.
* **Swagger Documentation:** Includes Swagger annotations for automatically generated API documentation.

### Additional Features

* **JWT Authentication:** Implements user authentication using JWT tokens (access and refresh tokens).
* **Role-Based Authorization:** Adds user roles (Customer/Administrator) and restricts access to certain API endpoints
based on role.
* **Redis Caching:** Caches purchased tickets in Redis for faster retrieval.
* **Kafka Integration:** Publishes ticket purchase events to a Kafka topic for asynchronous processing.
